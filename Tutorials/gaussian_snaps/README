This is a read me for myself for future reference. 

Below you have two situation: gaussian beam with a lens present, and without. The data without a folder represents the former. 

You have to characterize the beam waist, as a function of z, w(z), as it goes through free space, and then see how the lens differs from the free space projection. 

Moreover, you need to show the free space data from ZEMAX, is represented well with the analytical solution. 

Ta-da!
